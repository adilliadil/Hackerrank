Problem Statement
============

You will be given two integers A and B. You are required to compute the bitwise AND amongst all natural numbers lying between A and B, both inclusive.

### Input Format

First line of the input contains T, the number of testcases to follow. 
Each testcase in a newline contains A and B separated by a single space.

### Constraints

    1≤T≤200 
    0≤A≤B<232

### Output Format

Output one line per test case with the required bitwise AND.

### Sample Input :

    3 
    12 15 
    2 3 
    8 13
### Sample Output

    12 
    2
